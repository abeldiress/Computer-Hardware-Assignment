    explanation:
      "Answer: 4-6 \n\nAlthough gaming PC’s require high frequencies, they don’t necessarily need lots of cores. Gaming PC’s tend to concentrate their processing power into a single task, or very few tasks, therefore, having too many cores will actually hinder performance in most instances. On the other hand, 2 cores is too low as it is known to produce lower FPS rates. CPU’s developed by Ryzen and AMD are specifically designed with fewer cores and high frequency, making them a recommended choice in the gaming industry.",
